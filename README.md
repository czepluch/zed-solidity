# 💠 Solidity Language Support for Zed

Enhance your Zed editor with Solidity language support through this extension.

![CleanShot 2024-02-28 at 02 40 51 on Zed — example sol — zed-solidity@2x](https://github.com/zed-industries/extensions/assets/16494335/2af32291-3d9b-4975-b721-a819d349b085)

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/zarifpour/zed-solidity
```

### 2. Load the extension

Move the `zed-solidity` directory to `~/Library/Application Support/Zed/extensions/installed`.

**(Optional)** To ensure seamless updates from the extensions page upon the release of a new version, consider renaming the directory to `solidity`.

### 3. Installation Options (ensure Docker is running)

First, navigate to the relocated repository in `~/Library/Application Support/Zed/extensions/installed`:

```shell
cd zed-solidity
```

#### Option 1: Automated

Run the following command:

```shell
make
```

> That was easy!

#### Option 2: Manual

1. Clone the `tree-sitter-solidity` repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/JoranHonig/tree-sitter-solidity
```

2. Checkout the commit specified in `grammars/solidity.toml`:

```shell
git checkout 5cb506ae419c4ad620c77210fd47500d3d169dbc
```

3. Move into the `tree-sitter-solidity` directory:

```shell
cd tree-sitter-solidity
```

4. Build the WebAssembly (WASM) file (ensure Docker is running):

```shell
tree-sitter build-wasm
```

5. Rename the generated WASM file to `solidity.wasm`.

6. Relocate the `solidity.wasm` file to the `zed-solidity/grammars` directory within this repository.

7. Remove the `solidity.toml` file from the `zed-solidity/grammars` directory.

### 4. Restart Zed

Run the following command in Zed to reload extensions:

```shell
zed: reload extensions
```

Try opening a `.sol` file in Zed. You should see syntax highlighting.

> [!Note]
> If you still do not see syntax highlighting, try quitting Zed and restarting the application.
